Xtext 2.35.0 ...

## Call to Action: Secure the future maintenance of Xtext

As you might have recognized, the number of people contributing to Xtext on a regular basis has declined over the past years and so has the number of contributions. At the same time the amount of work for basic maintenance has stayed the same or even increased with the new release cadence of Java and the Eclipse simultaneous release. Briefly: The future maintenance of Xtext is at risk, at least in the current form and as part of the Eclipse Simrel. If you care, please join the discussion in [https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721).

## Testing

The `AbstractFormatterTest` base class has been added to the `org.eclipse.xtext.testing` package to provide a convenient way to test the formatter capabilities. The Xtext Domainmodel example project and the Xtend code base have been extended by concrete formatter test cases to demonstrate the usage of this framework class.
