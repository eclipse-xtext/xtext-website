## Call to Action: Secure the future maintenance of Xtext

As you might have recognized, the number of people contributing to Xtext on a regular basis has declined over the past years and so has the number of contributions. At the same time the amount of work for basic maintenance has stayed the same or even increased with the new release cadence of Java and the Eclipse simultaneous release. Briefly: The future maintenance of Xtext is at risk, at least in the current form and as part of the Eclipse Simrel. If you care, please join the discussion in [https://github.com/eclipse-xtext/xtext/issues/1721](https://github.com/eclipse-xtext/xtext/issues/1721).

## Breaking Changes

The `groupId` for Xtend Maven artifacts, including `xtend-maven-plugin`, is now `org.eclipse.xtext`, instead of `org.eclipse.xtend`.
A "relocation" is in place so everything should work also if using the old `groupId`.
However, we recommend everyone to use the `groupId` `org.eclipse.xtext` for all Xtend Maven artifacts starting from this release.
