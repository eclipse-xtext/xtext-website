## Call to Action: Secure the future maintenance of Xtext

As you might have recognized, the number of people contributing to Xtext on a regular basis has declined over the past years and so has the number of contributions. At the same time the amount of work for basic maintenance has stayed the same or even increased with the new release cadence of Java and the Eclipse simultaneous release. Briefly: The future maintenance of Xtext is at risk, at least in the current form and as part of the Eclipse Simrel. If you care, please join the discussion in [https://github.com/eclipse-xtext/xtext/issues/1721](https://github.com/eclipse-xtext/xtext/issues/1721).

## Relevant changes

## Breaking changes

Xtext now requires Java 17 as the minimal Java version and 2024-03 as the minimal target platform.

## Upgrades

## Deprecations

- We have no longer the capacity to geep up with the GWT support. So unless someone takes that part over, we will remove it with a future version.

## Removals
